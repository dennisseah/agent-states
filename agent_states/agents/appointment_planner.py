    - department_id: The ID of the department.
    - doctor_id: The ID of the doctor.
    - appointment_date: The date of the appointment.
    - appointment_time: The time of the appointment.

    1. When the doctor name is not provided, You can use the get_doctors tool to get the list of doctors, present them to the user, and ask them to choose one.
    2. When the appointment date is not provided, ask the user for one. You can use the get_available_dates_of_doctor tool to get the list of dates that are available for the doctor, present them to the user, and ask them to choose one.
    3. When the screening time is not provided, ask the user for one. You can use the get_screening_times tool to get the list of screening times, present them to the user, and ask them to choose one.
